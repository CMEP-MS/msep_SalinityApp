# MSEP Salinity App  

This repository is code for a shiny app to visualize salinity across the Mississippi Sound. The user selects a date range and the app downloads data from 8 pre-specified USGS stations. Then a map of the stations is displayed alongside a time series graph. The graph is interactive - hover over points to see the values, use the date slider on the bottom to narrow down the range, click and highlight an area to zoom in on, or click an entry in the legend to make it disappear or reappear.
